## STEPS

Thought there would be a lot of steps, hehe ?

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Before you do all of these -- 

In the backend folder change the name of the file `.env.sample` to only `.env`

Do a `npm install` inside the frontend and backend directory, and yeah have docker installed. ðŸ™‚

After the session I will be adding the resources underneath here and you guys can always take a look into that for Git Commands and Setup
